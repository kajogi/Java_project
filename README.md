# This is the final project for TTU course ICS0014 Java Technologies.
## This is a Currency Convertor program that converts between USD, GBP and EUR.

### Essentials
* Java JDK 1.8
* MySQL Connector/J (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

#### * The program pulls the rates from a MySQL database and calculates the result by multiplying the amount and the rate.
* For database connection, DataSource is used instead of DriverManager.
* Currency converter GUI is made using ComboBox and Database GUI is made using JFrame.
